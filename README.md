# Data Science blogpost 

This will show CRISP-DM process and used stackoverflow 2019 survey data.   

## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.



## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

What are the most preferred programming languages in 2020?
Â 
Which Web-Framework may help you to earn maximum salaries and highest job satisfaction?

What are the programming languages, database technologies, tools and frameworks most satisfied software developers are using on daily basis?

## File Descriptions

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. I've used Markdown cells to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information here.
